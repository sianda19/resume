# ResFast Resume Builder

A React Web Application which helps you build your resume by just following the different steps and simply entering your data.

The alignment, formatting and generation of your resume is automatically handled by ResFast, simply enter your data and get a pdf file of your resume!

## Future Scope

- Different Resume Templates
- Input validation to check whether user has actually entered the data, right now it doesn't check whether the mandatory fields have been filled or not.
- Text from the Rich Text Editor in the Job Description section is copied without any formatting (ex. bold, ul, ol, underline) so for future scope the text needs to be rendered with formatting in the generated resume.
- Feel free to raise an issue if you find a bug!
